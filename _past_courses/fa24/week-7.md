# Week 7 - Stretch 2 of 2

## Tues

Common gotchas:
- Make sure your github repo is public
- Create everything locally on your computer 1st
- Make sure you are in the correct folders / organize where the code is under the github desktop folder it desires to be i
- associate it to the github desktop app
- use the app to create the new repo on the fly, probably easiest option
- ensure you have a `.gitignore` file, not everyone's machines copied / produced these, though many did.

### Crit
- Recording of live crit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czJcArUPtco
- Live review of a well made examples:
  - https://github.com/tay3434/counter-app
  - https://github.com/DylanConnor28/counter-app
- Mood check; how we feeling about current progression?

## Next Stretch
- https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2147
- Using the HAX tooling, create a new repo and go through the process again. This time for a new element
- This element has a *ton* of detail as far as what to make and some examples of how to go about making it for something this small

## 10 min discussion
- Draw this on paper what it should look like? What does a demo look like?
- Come up with a plan among people in your pod. How are you going to approach this?
- Write out some steps. What are the first 5 steps you think you'll have to take AFTER creating it via the HAX tooling,  install, code on github, etc.
- What is unknown from reading the requirements? What do you have no idea how you'll tackle?
- Take a picture of your plan and post in teams replys for today
- We'll discuss / answer questions
  - Common next steps
  - Common questions

## My Github is having issues
- edit the following file: `.git/config`
- find the address that says `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git`
- change it to say: `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- use desktop to push up

## Working time
(I feel seen)

- We will start in class on this element with the expectation being that you get _as close to done_ as possible by **Thursday**
- We will discuss what has been made in class Thursday among pod and wider group discussions
- There is a 50% bonus oppurtunity on this assignment
- Code you would like live reviewed to improve upon please submit to Teams Wed night for review Thursday in class

## Thursday
- Recording of live crit / feedback - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeQHIVbZwt8
- Learning from an interesting proposed solution: [https://github.com/xTyten/un-sdg/](https://github.com/xTyten/un-sdg/)
- This solution has several flaws and is overly complex but it does work. No one's submission should look anything like this or we'll be aware you just copied this one, which I am writing here **is not an acceptable solution given how verbose it is and there are far simpler ways of doing this**. Only this person can turn it in this way and I am recommending not to.
- Let's get AI to help. I put the directions into a tool called [https://bolt.new](https://bolt.new)
- [https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb1-xhsigv?file=src%2Fun-sdg.js](https://stackblitz.com/edit/sb1-xhsigv?file=src%2Fun-sdg.js) - I took what bolt made, then cleaned it up to actually work. It has a lot wrong, but many things right. As always with AI, you must know how to read it to accurately use it.
- More time to work and ask questions

## Common questions
- `npm init @haxtheweb` to start the repo
- when this asks you about git, it will default to something like `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git` DO NOT USE THIS FORMAT
- insead change it to `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- If you already did accept the default see the next heading for how to fix it.

## My Github is having issues
- edit the following file: `.git/config`
- find the address that says `git@github.com:yourname/yourproject.git`
- change it to say: `https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git`
- use desktop to push up or the git capability built directly into VSCode.

## Homework
- **Because I am giving you a large chunk here for help, I want every 5 lines there to be a comment as to what that block of code does. You don't need to comment on the large array of objects and I highly recommend you use that piece, however every method should be commented, any time there is an if statement / looping logic, I'd like it commented as to what or why it is doing that**.
- https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2147 fully working solution
- published on vercel
- code on github
- link to whatever.vercel.app address + github code
