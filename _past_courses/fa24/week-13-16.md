# Week 13 - Final Project
## Tues
- There are two projects. You must select a project and state which project you are doing by end of class Tuesday. Read and explore the requirements of each. They are different projects but have similar scopes. One is far more state management heavy as well as very detail oriented in # of requirements. The other is a mix of state management, design, and data structure building on the previous project as far as scope.
- [\[project-2a\] Character Creator / rpg-me promotional tool](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/1414)
- [\[project-2b\] Use-cases dashboard comp](https://github.com/haxtheweb/issues/issues/2182)
- After making your selection, put in the comments for the issue that you're going to work on the one in question and post a link to the boilerplate hax CLI made repo as your starting point.

## Thursday
**A reminder of requirements for project creation and submission: PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED USING THE HAX TOOLING TO ENSURE WE ARE WRITING CODE USING PLATFORM LEVEL WEB COMPONENTS. SUBMISSIONS DONE IN TOOLING AND TECHNOLOGY NOT LIT.DEV BASED WILL NOT BE EVALUATED.**

We'll be grouping up based on project selected to answer the following discussion questions:

## project-2a Character Creator / rpg-me promotional tool
**Sit with 6 people total, not the people you've been collaborating with so that you both get different discussions / perspectives)**
- Where are you starting?
- What form inputs are you using?
- What fields are you going to add to your app to manage the relationship between the form and the character?
- What's the character sizing to be managed responsively?
- How are you approaching the "stateful" aspect of share links in the URL
- Any other considerations / unknowns?

- "we want to make things like 60% of the screen" - rpg-character requires a numerical value for height / width. It can't be % based bc of how SVGs work.

```js
const height = window.innerHeight;
// window width
const width = window.innerWidth;
console.log(height, width);
```

## project-2b Use-cases dashboard comp
- Where are you starting?
- Which of the comps are you going off of?
- What properties need to be accounted for in the data model?
- What is a good structure for the JSON file?
- How many unique elements are there to help with scoping?
- Any other considerations / unknowns?

This will run about 30 minutes and I'd like answers / take aways posted to the thread associated with your project. (adding below this post)

# Week 14 - Turkey
end of week 14, Sunday Dec 1 is when check in 1 is due

# Week 15,16
## Tues
I'll do a live review of two projects based on check in 1 that are both making great progress, giving feedback and time to ask questions. Then you'll have more time to work.
- [Class Recording of review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsdiRoCOuA8)
- Project A - https://github.com/Eglicky/rpg-new
- Project B - https://github.com/izzabizz5/hax-use-case-app

## Thusday
- Remote office hours - no class

## Sunday
- Check in 2 is due.
- This check in should include code that is largely working and in the right direction (3pts)
- demo built on vercel is required (2pts)
- any questions / issues you are having that you will bring to class / office hours for TAs (1pts)

# Week 16
## Tuesday
Live review of these two projects:
- https://github.com/tay3434/rpg-character/ 
- https://github.com/nazman-hub/HAX-dashboard 
- recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY8wnl40lgM 
More time to work and ask question
### "My icons won't load on vercel"
If you have having issues w/ icons on vercel but they work locally; try this. Run the following command:
```bash
npm install --save rollup-plugin-copy
```
then edit `rollup.config.js` and add this import
```js
import copy from 'rollup-plugin-copy';
```
then after the `html({}),` block in this object, call the following
```js
 copy({
  targets: [
    {
      src: 'node_modules/@haxtheweb/simple-icon/lib/svgs',
      dest: 'public',
    },
    {
      src: 'node_modules/@haxtheweb/hax-iconset/lib/svgs',
      dest: 'public',
    },
  ],
}),
```
similar past solution: https://github.com/btopro/haxcms-user-flow/blob/master/rollup.config.js

This *may* be needed if you use `simple-icon` but is not gaurunteed.

## Thursday
- Last chance to get help and resolve issues IRL
- Last class. Come to say goodbye / fist bump
- It's been fun working with you this semester. Good luck out there.
